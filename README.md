# Shelly Admin Express

An adminstration console written to manage a whole network of Shelly's and to enure that their configuration is homogenous. The goal of the development is build the application upon NodeJS/ExpressJS so that it can be deployed both as a plugin to run within the HomeAssistant user interface and also can be built using ElectronJS framework to make standalone applications for MacOS, Windows, Linux and mobile platforms.

The user interface is is entirely HTML5 and built upon Bootstrap 4 and Pug page templates.

This is prerelease software and is not yet feature complete.
